# Readme

If you have questions about this week's lab ANY TA for this class can help you.

## Data Visualization ðŸ“ˆðŸ‘€

This week we are learning about more ways to look at our data. How can we represent our data in better ways than just grids of numbers?

You don't need to submit anything this week. Just make sure you show up to lab, study the lab lesson, and execute all of the cells in the Lab Lesson notebook. Your UTA will mark your attendance to give you credit.


## Getting Started Againâ„¢

1. Log into SCI JupyterHub and start a terminal
2. Type in `git clone https://github.com/pitt-sci-cmpinf0010/Geopandas.git` and hit the enter key
3. This should download a folder to your JupyterHub with the lab (it should be called `Geopandas`)
4. Double click the new folder in the file explorer. You should see the lab contents.
5. Launch the `Lab-Exercises.ipynb` notebook. You can also launch `Lab-Lesson.ipynb` if you need a refresher on what the UTA went over in the skills lab.


### If JupyterHub doesn't work for you

Use Binder!

_**Important**:_ Binder does **not** always save your work. If you need to stop working on your lab for more than 30 minutes, you need to **download** your exercises notebook to you computer. Then, you can reupload it again later to continue your work.
